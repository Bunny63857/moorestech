       --Stylised Nature Pack--
______________________________________________
  Thanks for downloading my asset pack!

I'm still very new at this so if there
is anything wrong or you have any 
questions/ suggestions feel free to email
me at e.j.cobden@gmail.com 

______________________________________________
Note: When importing the package I noticed
All the shader materials show up pink in
the project editor, Im still working on why 
this would be. Though they all work fine in 
scene as is and if you want to fix the pink 
colour just reapply the shader to the
material.
